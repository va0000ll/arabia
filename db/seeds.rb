# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#

# 20.times do
#     User.create!(username: Faker::Name.unique.name, email: Faker::Internet.email, age: Faker::Number.number(digits: 2), gender: Faker::Gender.binary_type, password: '112233', password_confirmation: '112233')
# end
# puts "created users"
